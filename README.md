# Raspberry Pi DHT11 IoT Project

This project demonstrates an **IoT embedded system** built with a Raspberry Pi and a DHT11 digital sensor.  
The system collects **real-time temperature and humidity data**, processes it using Python, and stores/visualizes the results for monitoring and analysis.  

It was developed as the **final project for EECS3215 (Embedded Systems)** at York University, showcasing skills in **hardware-software integration, real-time data acquisition, and IoT pipeline design**.
